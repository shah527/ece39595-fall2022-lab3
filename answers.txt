(a) Pros:
    1. Agile development allows for extensive collaboration as the employees and clients directly stay in contact to exchange feedback, ideas etc.
    2. Agile development results in an improved outcome as in the cycles, the feedback received helps in identifying the flaws and improving upon them
    Cons:
    1. Since there are multiple goals and tasks that need to be focused on in Agile development, specific goals often fall behind or not get proper care
    2. There is a lack of documentation in the Agile methodology, which could lead to bigger issues in the long run
(b) The Scrum Master leads the team through Agile project management, and is responsible for the team members and guides them to success. A Product Owner, on the other hand, plans the sprints and is responsible for the project's success
